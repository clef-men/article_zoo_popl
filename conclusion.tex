\section{Conclusion}

We presented \Zoo, a framework for the verification of concurrent \OCamlFive programs.
It has been used to verify sequential imperative algorithms and a library of lock-free data structures.
While it is not yet available on \texttt{opam}, it can be installed and used in other \Rocq projects.
