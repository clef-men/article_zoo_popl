\section{Physical equality}
\label{sec:physical_equality}

The notion of \emph{physical equality} is ubiquitous in fine-grained concurrent algorithms.
It appears not only in the semantics of the \ocamlinline{==} operator, but also in the semantics of the \ocamlinline{Atomic.compare_and_set} primitive, which atomically sets an atomic reference to a desired value if its current content is physically equal to an expected value.
This primitive is commonly used to try committing an atomic operation in a retry loop, as in the \ocamlinline{push} and \ocamlinline{pop} functions of \cref{fig:stack}.

\subsection{Physical equality in \HeapLang}

In \HeapLang, this primitive is provided but restricted.
Indeed, its semantics is only defined if either the expected or the desired value fits in a single memory word in the \HeapLang value representation: literals (booleans, integers and pointers\footnote{\HeapLang allows arbitrary pointer arithmetic and therefore inner pointers. This is forbidden in both \OCaml and \ZooLang, as any reachable value has to be compatible with the garbage collector.}) and literal injections\footnote{\HeapLang has no primitive notion of constructor, only pairs and injections (left and right).}; otherwise, the program is stuck.
In practice, this restriction forces the programmer to introduce an indirection~\cite{iris/examples,DBLP:journals/pacmpl/JungLPRTDJ20,DBLP:conf/cpp/VindumB21} to physically compare complex values, \eg lists.
Furthermore, when the semantics is defined, values are compared using their \Rocq representations; physical equality boils down to \Rocq equality.

\subsection{Physical equality in \OCaml}

In \OCaml, physical equality is more tricky and often considered dangerous.
\emph{Structural equality}, which we describe in \cref{sec:structural_equality}, should be the preferred way of comparing values.
However, physical equality is typically much faster than structural equality, as it basically compiles to only one assembly instruction.
Also, the \ocamlinline{Atomic.compare_and_set} requires the comparison to be atomic, which is the case for physical equality but not structural equality.

In particular, the semantics of physical equality is \emph{non-deterministic}.
To see why, consider the case of \emph{immutable blocks} representing constructors and immutable records (as opposed to \emph{mutable blocks} representing mutable records), \eg \ocamlinline{Some 0}.
The physical comparison of two seemingly identical immutable blocks, according to the \Rocq representation (essentially a tag and a list of fields), may return \ocamlinline{false}.
Indeed, at runtime, a non-empty immutable block is represented by a pointer to a tagged memory block.
In this case, physical equality is just pointer comparison.
It is clear that two pointers being distinct does not imply the pointed memory blocks are.
In other words, we cannot determine the result of physical comparison just by looking at the abstract values.

The question is then: what guarantees do we get when physical equality returns \ocamlinline{true} and when it returns \ocamlinline{false}?
Given such guarantees, denoted by \coqinline{val_physeq} and \coqinline{val_physneq}, the non-deterministic semantics is reflected in the logic through the following specification:

\begin{coqcode}
Lemma physeq_spec v1 v2 :
  {{{ True }}}
    v1 == v2
  {{{ b, RET #b; ⌜(if b then val_physeq else val_physneq) v1 v2⌝ }}}
Proof. ... Qed.
\end{coqcode}

The \OCaml manual documents a partial specification for physical equality, which is precise for basic types such as references, but does not clearly extend to structured values containing a mix of immutable and mutable constructors.
The only guarantee that it provides for all values is: if two values are physically equal, they are also structurally equal.
This means we don't learn anything when two values are physically distinct.

In the following, we will explore both cases, looking at the optimizations that the compiler or the runtime system may perform.
We will show that the aforementioned guarantee is arguably not sufficient to verify interesting concurrent programs and attempt to establish stronger guarantees.

\subsection{When physical equality returns \ocamlinline{true}}

Let us go back to the concurrent stack of \cref{fig:stack} and more specifically the \ocamlinline{push} function.
To prove the atomic specification given in \cref{sec:zoo}, we rely on the fact that, if \ocamlinline{Atomic.compare_and_set} returns \ocamlinline{true}, we actually observe the same list of values in the sense of \Rocq equality.
However, assuming only structural equality as per \OCaml's specification of physical equality, this cannot be proven.
To see why, consider, \eg, a stack of references (\ocamlinline{'a ref}).
As structural equality is indeed \emph{structural}, it traverses the references without comparing their \emph{physical identities}.
In other words, we cannot conclude the references are \emph{exactly} the same.
Hence, we cannot prove the specification.

This conclusion might seem surprising and counterintuitive.
Indeed, we know that physical equality essentially boils down to a comparison instruction, so we should be able to say more.
Departing from \OCaml's imprecise specification, let us attempt to establish stronger guarantees.
We assume the following classification of values: booleans, integers, mutable blocks (pointers), immutable blocks, functions.

The easy cases are mutable blocks and functions.
Each of these two classes is disjoint from the others.
We can reasonably assume that, when physical equality returns \ocamlinline{true} and one of the compared values belongs to either of these classes, the two values are actually the same in \Rocq.
As far as we are aware, there is no optimization that could break this.

Booleans, integers and empty immutable blocks are represented by immediate integers through an encoding.
This encoding induces conflicts: two seemingly distinct values in \Rocq may have the same encoding.
For example, the following tests all return \ocamlinline{true} (\ocamlinline{Obj.repr} is an unsafe primitive revealing the memory representation of a value):

\begin{ocamlcode}
let test1 = Obj.repr false == Obj.repr 0 (* true *)
let test2 = Obj.repr None  == Obj.repr 0 (* true *)
let test3 = Obj.repr []    == Obj.repr 0 (* true *)
\end{ocamlcode}

The semantics of unrestricted physical equality has to reflect these conflicts.
In our experience, restricting compared values similarly to typing is quite burdensome; the specification of polymorphic data structures using physical equality has to be systematically restricted.
In summary, when physical equality on immediate values returns \ocamlinline{true}, it is guaranteed that they have the same encoding.

Finally, let us consider the case of non-empty immutable blocks.
At runtime, they are represented by pointers to tagged memory blocks.
At first approximation, it is tempting to say that physically equal immutable blocks really are definitionally equal in \Rocq.
Alas, this is not true.
To explain why, we have to recall that the \OCaml compiler and the runtime system (\eg, through hash-consing) may perform \emph{sharing}: immutable blocks containing physically equal fields may be shared.
For example, the following tests may return \ocamlinline{true}:

\begin{ocamlcode}
let test1 = Some 0 == Some 0 (* true *)
let test2 = [0;1]  == [0;1]  (* true *)
\end{ocamlcode}

On its own, sharing is not a problem.
However, coupled with representation conflicts, it can be surprising.
Indeed, consider the \ocamlinline{any} type defined as:

\begin{ocamlcode}
type any = Any : 'a -> any
\end{ocamlcode}

The following tests may return \ocamlinline{true}:

\begin{ocamlcode}
let test1 = Any false == Any 0 (* true *)
let test2 = Any None  == Any 0 (* true *)
let test3 = Any []    == Any 0 (* true *)
\end{ocamlcode}

Now, going back to the \ocamlinline{push} function of \cref{fig:stack}, we have a problem.
Given a stack of \ocamlinline{any}, it is possible for the \ocamlinline{Atomic.compare_and_set} to observe a current list (\eg, \ocamlinline{[Any 0]}) physically equal to the expected list (\eg, \ocamlinline{[Any false]}) while these are actually distinct in \Rocq.
In short, the expected specification of \cref{sec:zoo} is incorrect.
To fix it, we would need to reason \emph{modulo physical equality}, which is non-standard and quite burdensome.

We believe this really is a shortcoming, at least from the verification perspective.
Therefore, we propose to extend \OCaml with \emph{generative immutable blocks}\footnote{\urlAnonymous{https://github.com/clef-men/ocaml/tree/generative_constructors}}.
These generative blocks are just like regular immutable blocks, except they cannot be shared.
Hence, if physical equality on two generative blocks returns \ocamlinline{true}, these blocks are definitionally equal in \Rocq.
At user level, this notion is materialized by \emph{generative constructors}.
For instance, to verify the expected \ocamlinline{push} specification, we can use a generative version of lists:

\begin{ocamlcode}
type 'a list =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * 'a list [@generative]
\end{ocamlcode}

\subsection{When physical equality returns \ocamlinline{false}}

\input{figures/rcfd}

Most formalizations of physical equality in the literature do not give any guarantee when physical equality returns \ocamlinline{false}.
Many use-cases of physical equality, in particular retry loops, can be verified with only sufficient conditions on \ocamlinline{true}.
However, in some specific cases, more information is needed.

Consider the \ocamlinline{Rcfd} module from the \Eio~\cite{eio} library, an excerpt of which is given in \cref{fig:rcfd}\footnote{We make use of \emph{atomic record fields} as introduced in \cref{sec:atomic-record-fields}.}.
Thomas Leonard, its author, suggested that we verify this real-life example because of its intricate logical state.
However, we found out that it is also relevant regarding the semantics of physical equality.
Essentially, it consists in wrapping a file descriptor in a thread-safe way using reference-counting.
At creation in the \ocamlinline{make} function, the wrapper starts in the \ocamlinline{Open} state.
At some point, it can switch to the \ocamlinline{Closing} state in the \ocamlinline{close} function and can never go back to the \ocamlinline{Open} state.
Crucially, the \ocamlinline{Open} state does not change throughout the lifetime of the data structure.

The interest of \ocamlinline{Rcfd} lies in the \ocamlinline{close} function.
First, the function reads the state.
If this state is \ocamlinline{Closing}, it returns \ocamlinline{false}; the wrapper has been closed.
If this state is \ocamlinline{Open}, it tries to switch to the \ocamlinline{Closing} state using \ocamlinline{Atomic.Loc.compare_and_set}; if this attempt fails, it also returns \ocamlinline{false}.
In this particular case, we would like to prove that the wrapper has been closed, or equivalently that \ocamlinline{Atomic.Loc.compare_and_set} cannot have observed \ocamlinline{Open}.
Intuitively, this is true because there is only one \ocamlinline{Open}.

Obviously, we need some kind of guarantee related to the \emph{physical identity} of \ocamlinline{Open} when \ocamlinline{Atomic.Loc.compare_and_set} returns \ocamlinline{false}.
If \ocamlinline{Open} were a mutable block, we could argue that this block cannot be physically distinct from itself; no optimization we know of would allow that.
Unfortunately, it is an immutable block, and immutable blocks are subject to more optimizations.
In fact, something surprising but allowed\footnote{This has been confirmed by \OCaml experts developing the \Flambda backend.} by \OCaml can happen: \emph{unsharing}, the dual of sharing.
Indeed, any immutable block can be unshared, that is reallocated.
For example, the following test may theoretically return \ocamlinline{false}:

\begin{ocamlcode}
let x = Some 0
let test = x == x (* false *)
\end{ocamlcode}

Going back to \ocamlinline{Rcfd}, we have a problem: in the second branch, the \ocamlinline{Open} block corresponding to \ocamlinline{prev} could be unshared, which would make \ocamlinline{Atomic.Loc.compare_and_set} fail.
Hence, we cannot prove the expected specification; in fact, the program as it is written has a bug.

To remedy this unfortunate situation, we propose to reuse the notions of generative immutable blocks, that we introduced to prevent sharing, to also forbid unsharing by the \OCaml compiler -- we implemented this in an experiment branch of \OCaml.

In our semantics, each generative block is annotated with a \emph{logical identifier}\footnote{Actually, for practical reasons, we distinguish identified and unidentified generative blocks.} representing its physical identity, much like a pointer for a mutable block.
If physical equality on two generative blocks returns \ocamlinline{false}, the two identifiers are necessarily distinct.
Given this semantics, we can verify the \ocamlinline{close} function.
Indeed, if \ocamlinline{Atomic.Loc.compare_and_set} fails, we now know that the identifiers of the two blocks, if any, are distinct.
As there is only one \ocamlinline{Open} block whose identifier does not change, it cannot be the case that the current state is \ocamlinline{Open}, hence it is \ocamlinline{Closing}.
We can verify this function after adding the following annotation:

\begin{ocamlcode}
type state =
  | Open of Unix.file_descr [@generative]
  | Closing of (unit -> unit)
\end{ocamlcode}

\subsection{Summary}

In summary, we give the following specification to physical equality in \ZooLang, which also serves as a precise specification of physical equality of a practical fragment of \OCaml:

\begin{itemize}
\item On values whose low-level representation is
  an immediate integer, physical equality is immediate equality.
\item On values whose low-level representation are
  mutable blocks at some location, or generative immutable blocks with some identity, physical equality is equality of locations or identities.
\item On values whose low-level representation are immutable blocks, physical-equality is under-specified, but it implies that the blocks have the same tags and their arguments are in turn physically equal.
\item Two values that fall into different categories above are never physically equal.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Physical equality -- alternative proposal}
%
%The notion of \emph{physical equality} is ubiquitous in fine-grained concurrent algorithms.
%It appears not only in the semantics of the \ocamlinline{==} operator, but also in the semantics of the \ocamlinline{Atomic.compare_and_set} primitive, which atomically sets an atomic reference to a desired value if its current content is physically equal to an expected value.
%This primitive is commonly used to try committing an atomic operation in a retry loop, as in the \ocamlinline{push} and \ocamlinline{pop} functions of \cref{fig:stack}.
%
%At the same time this notion is difficult to specify correctly, and this can result in dangerous gaps between the programming language used to write code and the semantics used for its verification.
%
%\ZooLang has a grammar of values, and most operations are specified by defining how they compute with \ZooLang values. Its definition may look as follows in Rocq (simplified slightly):
%\begin{coqcode}
%Inductive literal :=
%  | Bool (b : bool)
%  | Int (n : nat)
%  | Loc (l : location)
%  | Proph (pid : prophet_id)
%  | Poison.
%
%Inductive val :=
%  | Lit (lit : literal)
%  | Recs (i : nat) (recs : list (binder * binder * expr))
%  | Block (tag : nat) (vs : list val).
%\end{coqcode}
%
%For example, the value $'\texttt{Cons} (42, \texttt{§}\texttt{Nil})$ is represented in Rocq as \coqinline{Block 1 [Lit (Int 42), Block 0 []]}. Notice that immutable blocks are represented in Rocq using the \coqinline{Block} constructor directly, and \emph{not} as a location (\coqinline{Loc}) allocated on the heap. We use locations only for \emph{mutable} records. We would say that our representation of \ZooLang values is \emph{high-level}, as close to the surface syntax as reasonably possible. This distinction is important to make verification pleasant in practice, by reducing the number of locations and heap indirections that the programmer needs to work with during verification. A \ZooLang tuple is directly a tuple, etc., and this design decision of using high-level values is important to the verification experience.
%\Xclement{Not only that, but assuming full ownership of arguments of immutable blocks would be incorrect.}
%
%It is tempting to specify, as \HeapLang does, that physical equality decides equality between high-level values. This specification makes sense for immediate values (integers, booleans), and for mutable records which are compared by location. But it is incorrect on immutable blocks, and \HeapLang essentially does not specify its behavior on those values. Yet programmers use physical equality on immutable blocks in practice, as in our example of a Treiber stack of \cref{fig:stack}.
%
%Defining physical equality as equality of high-level values is problematic in two opposite ways:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Some distinct high-level values are physically equal in OCaml, for example \ocamlinline{0} and \ocamlinline{false}. Their type differ, but it possible to store them in an existential type where they can be compared for physical equality:
%\begin{ocamlcode}
%type any = Any : 'a -> any
%let test1 = Any false == Any 0 (* true *)
%\end{ocamlcode}
%This shows that even on immediate values, specifying physical equality as equality of high-level values is convenient but incorrect in practice.
%
%\item A deeper problem is that some \emph{definitionally equal} high-level values may be physically distinct.
%  For example, if \ocamlinline{x} is defined as the integer \ocamlinline{42}, then \ocamlinline{(x :: []) == (42 :: [])} may or may not  hold, depending on the OCaml implementation being used.
%  But one can prove that both arguments are definitionally equal in Rocq, so physical equality cannot be modeled by a Rocq function of type \coqinline{val -> val -> bool}.
