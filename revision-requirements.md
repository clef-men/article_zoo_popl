> - Provide a detailed mapping from the paper to the Rocq development (either in the artifact itself, or as part of the paper).
> - Give a formal definition of the physical (dis)equality predicates in the paper
> - Replace references to private communication with links to PRs, issues, RFCs
> - Add a more detailed comparison with Osiris, ideally already early in the paper to avoid confusion about claims like that HeapLang is the closest language to OCaml in the Iris ecosystem
> - Add a comparison to DRFCaml. In particular, explain that DRFCaml distinguishes between non-atomic accesses and atomic accesses and how this compares to the accesses provided by Zoo
> - Consider shrinking the discussion in Section 4.1 (but the full version can be included in an appendix)
> - Mention the possibility of upstreaming [@generative] and other new features
> - Provide a discussion of which features from OCaml are missing in ZooLang and how complex it would be to add them.
