> This paper presents Zoo, a framework for verifying concurrent OCaml
> programs. Zoo is built on top of the Iris separation logic
> framework. Since Iris is already a highly expressive separation logic,
> the challenge in developing a tool like Zoo lies not in coming up with
> an extension to separation logic per se, but rather in building
> a faithful model of the semantics of the subset of OCaml supported by
> the framework and then deriving suitable reasoning rules on top. It
> turns out that doing so caused the authors to discover a number of
> subtleties and corner cases in concurrent OCaml, which then led to
> them developing new extensions/changes to OCaml, some of which have
> been upstreamed and are slated for release. To demonstrate Zoo's
> effectiveness, the authors have used it to verify several libraries
> for concurrent data structures from OCaml, uncovering bugs related to
> the above subtleties in some of these libraries.

> Verification research often targets algorithms in abstract and

> errors in existing OCaml concurrency libraries. They develop solutions
> to these problems, with one fix being incorporated into mainline
> OCaml. Furthermore, the authors identify issues with the specification
> of physical equality in concurrent algorithms and create a compiler
> extension to resolve them.  Using these extensions, the authors verify

> On the surface, this seems like a very strong paper and with a solid

> This paper presents a verification framework for concurrent OCaml
> programs in Rocq.  It consists of a core untyped language with an
> operational semantics equipped with an Iris program logic, and
> a translator from OCaml programs to Rocq representation in the core
> language.  The framework is used to verify data-structures from
> existing OCaml 5 libraries.  The paper also presents an extension to
> OCaml adding support for atomic record fields, and discuss subtleties
> regarding the treatment of physical equality, which is of particular
> importance when reasoning about concurrent programs using CAS.
> 
> **Strengths:**
> * design of an extension to OCaml that will allow existing codebase to
>   remove performance workarounds using unsafe idioms; and it is
>   expected to be released as part of OCaml 5.4 -- the paper give
>   a detailed description of the interaction with the OCaml community
>   and developers that resulted in this work.
> 
> * the paper highlights subtleties regarding the treatment of physical
>   equality, which is of particular importance when reasoning about
>   concurrent programs using CAS.  Even though they give
>   a specification tuned to OCaml, the presentation of section 5 should
>   be useful for future work on the formalisation of other languages.
> 
> **Weaknesses:**
> * the treatment of concurrency only supports an SC memory model, with
>   future support for weak behaviours planned based on the Cosmo
>   separation separation logic.

> Is there a particular reason for defining a new Iris core language for
