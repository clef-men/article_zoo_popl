\section{Persistent data structures}
\label{sec:persistent}

To further demonstrate the practicality of \Zoo, we verified a collection of persistent data structures.
This includes purely functional data structures such as persistent stack and queue, but also efficient imperative implementations of persistent array~\citep*{DBLP:conf/ml/ConchonF07}, store~\citep*{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/AllainC0S24} and union-find~\citep*{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/AllainC0S24}.

Currently, verification of purely functional programs is conducted in \ZooLang, which is deeply embedded inside \Rocq.
However, in the future, it would be desirable to be able to verify them directly in \Rocq, through a translation to \Gallina.
Similarly to \Hacspec~\citep*{DBLP:conf/cpp/HaselwarterHHWH24}, these two translations would come with a generated proof of equivalence.
